<p>&#129;&#9;This is the work in progress webcite of Connor N. Calarco.  I hope for this cite to eventually become something of a blog/database of my work/web agrigator, and that the programing section of the database of my work will act as a somthing of a portfolio.  This part of the cite is hosted with github pages but as HTML is not my main focus, I plan to host this over many difrent self hosting and other sites all conected together, a process I am coining as a webcite.
