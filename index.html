<h1>Work in Progress</h1>
I hope for this cite to eventually become something of a blog/database of my work/web agrigator, and that the programing section of the database of my work will act as a somthing of a portfolio.  This part of the cite is hosted with github pages but as HTML is not my main focus, I plan to host this over many different self hosting and other sites all conected together, a process I am coining as a webcite.  <a href=http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/ title="Althou I am even more efficent, if a bit less clean">For all sections of the cite's HTML that I can edit the HTML has been made as small as posible.<a>  In my opinion ALL css is bloat, so I swear to god I will never code in it even throu style tags in html.  This is getting harder as most of the non css guides for HTML were written many years ago and many of the fancier bits of HTML are depriciating or do not work in the same way as when the guides were writen.  You never know I may eventualy write a guide for plain html web markup.
