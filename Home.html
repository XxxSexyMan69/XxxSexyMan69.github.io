<h1>Home Page</h1>
<h2>This site is a work in progress</h2>
&emsp;I hope for this site to eventually become something of a blog/database of my work/web agrigator, and that the programing section of the database of my work will act as a something of a portfolio.  <a href=http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/ title="Althou I am even more efficient, if a bit less clean" target="_blank">For all sections of the site's HTML that I can edit the HTML has been made as small as possible.<a>  In my opinion ALL css is bloat, so I swear to god I will never code in it even throu style tags in html.  This is getting harder as most of the non css guides for HTML were written many years ago and many of the fancier bits of HTML are depreciating or do not work in the same way as when the guides were written.  You never know I may eventually write a guide for plain html web markup.

<h2>Update #1</h2>
&emsp;Although still a WIP I have begun to add a portfolio of my work here, somthing I could have sword I already started.  Not all of it is up yet, when it is ||| be sure to update here.  I also have written an amount on Fizz Buzz, so expect that up as soon as I find were I want to host it.
